			## Movie Watchlist
Movie Watchlist has two HTML pages: index.html and watchlist.html.\
The search button on the index page calls the OMDB API with the title searched for\
and displays search results.
The 'add to watchlist' button <img src="/images/plussign.png" height="20px" /> saves that data to local storage.\
The watchlist.html page loads and displays data from local storage.\
The <img src="/images/minussign.png" height="20px" /> button deletes the movie from local storage.\
